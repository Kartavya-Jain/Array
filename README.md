Reverse.cpp
This is a program for reversing elements in an array. I have taken an array of fixed size i.e. 5. It will take input from the user and reverse all the elements.
The program will run as follows:
Enter numbers of array:27
91
56
48
15
Before reversing the values: 27 91 56 48 15
After reversing the values: 15 48 56 91 27

63
59
32
12
76
85
24
42 63 59 32 12 76 85 24
